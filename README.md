# Jinu Kpop - Advanced Futuristic Link Hub


This repository contains a polished, futuristic, dark/light-mode personal landing page: **Jinu Kpop - Tech & KPDH Fan**. The project is split into separate files so you can upload each file to GitHub easily.


**Files included**
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — all styles, animations, and responsive rules
- `script.js` — interactivity, theme, easter eggs, music controls
- `assets/` — (optional) place your favicon, logo, or local audio files here


---


## Quick setup (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload all files and the `assets/` folder.
3. In repo Settings -> Pages, set the branch to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and root folder `/`.
4. Your site will be served at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>` shortly.

## How to change the music
- **Spotify embed:** Open `index.html`, find the `data-spotify` attribute on the `#music-controls` element or use the UI ("Set Spotify Link") and paste a Spotify share link (playlist/track/artist). The embed updates automatically.
- **Custom audio file (MP3):** Upload an MP3 to your repo (for example `assets/music.mp3`). In the page UI, switch to "Custom Audio" and paste the raw GitHub file link (e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<user>/<repo>/main/assets/music.mp3`).

## Easter eggs & features
- **Konami code** (↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → B A) triggers *Ultra Neon Mode* with extra particle burst.
- Click the logo 5 times to reveal a hidden fan-card and secret message.
- Hidden keyboard shortcut `M` toggles music play/pause.
- Theme (Dark/Light) persists using `localStorage`.
